Q. State the difference between Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

Answer: Cocoa and Cocoa Touch are two of Apple's widely used application frameworks used for building applications. However, they differ in the following ways:

Cocoa
* It is an application framework for building applications that run on Mac OS X.
* Frameworks such as Foundation and AppKit are incorporated into Cocoa.
* Cocoa classes use the NS (used for all classes and constants in the Cocoa framework) prefix (like NSTextField, NSWindow).

Cocoa Touch
* It is the application framework for building applications that run on devices like iPhones and iPads.
* Cocoa Touch is a combination of frameworks such as Foundation and UIKit.
* Cocoa Touch classes, on the other hand, use the UI (used for all classes and constants in the Cocoa Touch framework) prefix (like UITextField and UIWindow)
